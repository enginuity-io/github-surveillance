GitHub Surveillance Application Uninstallation

The uninstallation of the GitHub Surveillance application has been initiated.

Resources being removed:
- Deployments (Frontend and Backend)
- Services (Frontend and Backend)
- Ingress
- Secrets
- ConfigMaps (if any)
- PersistentVolumeClaims (if any)

To verify that all resources have been removed, run:

  kubectl get all -l app=githubsurveillance -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

If you find any resources still present, you can manually remove them with:

  kubectl delete deployment -l app=githubsurveillance -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  kubectl delete service -l app=githubsurveillance -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  kubectl delete ingress -l app=githubsurveillance -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  kubectl delete secret -l app=githubsurveillance -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

If you're using a local development environment, don't forget to clean it up:

  cd /path/to/githubsurveillance
  docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
